_Exercise assignment for the course [Introduction to AI (partII)](https://inf-git.fh-rosenheim.de/aai-ai2/hsro-aai-ai2-github-io) in the [Bachelor of AAI](https://www.th-rosenheim.de/en/technology/computer-science-mathematics/applied-artificial-intelligence-bachelors-degree) at [Rosenheim University of Applied Sciences](http://www.th-rosenheim.de)_


# 02 - Train your own Decision Tree

## Exercise 1

Take a look at the Decision Tree – Iris Jupyter notebook and take the Decision Tree – (Titanic notebook)[] as a template which we have discussed during the lecture.
 
1. Create a decision tree, that can classify a given size of a flower into the iris categories setosa, versicolor and virginica

2. Print the tree

3. How good is the prediction? What can we expect when we look at the gini parameters?


>Note: Partition the given data set into train and test so that we can see how good the method actually applies to the classification problem.

Additional: calculate the fraction of correct predictions per category
